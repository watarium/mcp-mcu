# mcp-mcu

This is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that supports uploading firmware to ESP32 devices using PlatformIO.

## Features

- üõ†Ô∏è Build and upload code to ESP32 boards using the `pio` command
- ü§ñ Given an ESP32 board model and a connected module (e.g., BME280), the server can suggest connection guides and code examples
- üì¶ Supports both complete PlatformIO projects and inline definitions of `platformio.ini` and `main.cpp`

## Requirements

- Python 3.12 or higher
- [PlatformIO CLI](https://platformio.org/install/cli) must be available in your environment
- `mcp[cli]` must be installed
- Tested on macOS; may also work on Linux or Windows
- Tested using VS Code Copilot integration

## Tested Devices

- Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32C3
- M5Stack Core2
